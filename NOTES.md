Notes on with Aaron feb 28th First meeting.


def: Credential - OLAF, it allows authorization for google drive. Like a bouncer giving you a wirstbrand to go in.

def: Singularity is like Docker. But its for savio and high performance computing systems. eventually we will use it. 

1) We are looking backward through the notebook. To get a high level overview of whats happenings. ( the notebook Adam shared in the general slack channel

2) We just downloaded the docker and made an account 
Its doing its thing in my top toolbar 

3) we are running commands in docker. 
  a) open terminal
  b) docker run -it ubuntu
  c) docker run -it ubuntu
now we are in a docker container.
type "exit" to exit out of it. 

to open docker container run:
```
docker run -it ubuntu
```

to exit: `exit`

6) created a new git repo for myself. 
7) added Aaron as a colloborator 

8) added this file note. 
9) told Adam that we need our team to be submitted to Savio people. 

Alan:
  So the savio cluster is something we are using, but that isn't the main focus per say. Its about connecting it to everything like google drive and working it seamlessly through all the clould services we are using the shared notebook
